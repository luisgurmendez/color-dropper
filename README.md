### Picsart coding challenge

"Your team needs to create an ability for users to pick a color from canvas.
The task is to build a color dropper."

## Launch and use the app

1. Ensure you have a node version `^16.13.0` installed, run `node --version`, if this is not the case,
   then try using `nvm` or a similar tool to switch to a compatible version
   for instance:  `nvm install 16.13.0` then `nvm use 16.13.0`
2. Install the dependencies running `yarn` 
3. Build the app with `yarn build`
4. Run `yarn start` to serve the app locally
5. Open your browser of choice and go to `localhost:3000`

Use the images in the `public/assets/` folder (or add your owns through the file input button) 
to play with different image types, and use the "Use transparency" and "Use real image size"
configs to unlock different behaviors.

## Test
To run the tests run `yarn test`
